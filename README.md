# Cost Flow Analysis Dashboard

This project is a demonstration case inside a Techathon for students to explore **Dash** as a powerful plotting and web application framework for Python. It illustrates a navigation use case for analyzing multi-dimensional cost flows within a large organization (e.g., Deutsche Bank).

## Overview

The dashboard provides an interactive interface to visualize cost distributions across various dimensions such as:
- **Regions** (Level 2)
- **Countries** (Level 3)
- **Divisions** (Level 4)
- **Services** (Level 5)

It features:
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Sankey diagrams, bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps.
- **Draggable Layout**: Users can rearrange charts to customize their view.
- **AI Integration**: A demo section for AI-based cost prediction using PyTorch models.
- **User Authentication**: A basic login system (demo credentials provided).
